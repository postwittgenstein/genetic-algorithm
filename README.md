GENETIC ALGORITHM
===
The purpose of this project, is to implement a Genetic Algorithm. Which will generate some words having each one five letters, evaluating a large " Population " generated after the crossover randomly, to determine at the end one word meeting our criteria of selection ( Having five similar letters ).

The algorithm and the methods were extracted from this minimalistic explication of this tutorial :

and other papers i'll publish them sources later.
